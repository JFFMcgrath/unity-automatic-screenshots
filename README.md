# Unity - Automated Progress Screenshots

An automated utility that takes progress screenshots of your Unity work. A nice way to skirt that end-of-project regret: 

"I wish I had progress screenshots to see the evolution of this!"

On certain events - this will save a screenshot with and without UI (exploting a bug in Unity's screenshot size argument that leads to no UI being shown - it may be fixed in some update, so this line will be irrelevant).

**Instructions:**

* Take these folders
* Drop them in your Unity Project
* Done

**Screenshots are saved:**

* Everytime you save a scene
  
* A given (randomized) interval after you press 'Play' (between SCREENSHOT_INTERVAL_FIRST_LOWER and SCREENSHOT_INTERVAL_FIRST_UPPER)
  
* At randomized intervals during play (between SCREENSHOT_INTERVAL_LOWER and SCREENSHOT_INTERVAL_UPPER)
  

Randomization is added to try to 'mix it up' a little, and make sure we aren't always capturing the same moments during play.

Screenshots are output to your root project directory, in subfolder: "FreeProgressPictures".

No idea where this whole "Free" prefix came from. I just started using it one day.

Probably some semi-conscious yearning to stalk the fields, instead of stalking bureacracy.

We'll never know!

**Notes:**

* Yeah... I have a class called "StateMachine" in there, and it's *not* in a namespace, so that's likely to irritate the hell out of you. It's a *really* common class name. Go nuts renaming it or what-not. I've been using Unity since back before namespaces weren't supported, and it's a whole *thing* I keep forgetting about in a non-enterprise context.
